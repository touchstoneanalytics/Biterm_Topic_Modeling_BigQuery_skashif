5.0,We have a beagle..,"January 3, 2019",Yes,And if you have one like the one I have..you know the situation we are in. She can go from zero to all out apocalyptic barking in 1.5 seconds. This was a desperate  attempt at getting her to quiet down and it worked. She has never never never been this under control in her 5 yrs. she has let out a few barks but she immediately reacts by looking around and then...she stops. She has barked once in 2 hrs. She has stopped the ‚Äúbark at anything for any reason with the loudest possible bark that goes in for 10 minutes‚Äù nonsense. I‚Äôve always had to bring her in when little ones were napping bc she would wake them and now she actually seems to be enjoying playing in the yard without always being ‚Äúon alert‚Äù. Not sure how long it will last but it is working for right now.,16
5.0,Five Stars,"December 20, 2016",Yes,sturdy and clear,31
5.0,Great quality and got the job done!,"December 26, 2017",Yes,I have a husky and when she sheds her coat it's alot of hair. I wanted to try a deshedding brush to see if I could help her get all that hair off her sooner. I couldn't be more happy with the Twobiu pet brush as it definitely got the job done. After just one use I had almost a trash bags full of hair from my husky Annie. It came with two different size tools the large and small. It's very easy to use and switching the brush head was very simple just a click of a button. I'm happy with it and my Annie was happy to have all that extra hair gone. If you need a good deshedding tool then look no further than right here.,6
3.0,"if you're looking for something sturdy, this really isn't a great option","May 4, 2017",Yes,"These bowls are okay, there's nothing really special about them but given their price they will do the trick.  However, if you're looking for something sturdy, this really isn't a great option.  The rubber ring which runs the over a small lip around the bottom comes off way too easily, especially with eager eaters.  It became such a hassle I threw them out after about a week.  Also, the manufacturer states these bowls will hold 32 ounces but I think that's a bit of a stretch.  Perhaps if they're filled all the way to the tippy top.  The stainless steel is a little on the flimsy side, we dropped one of the bowls from about a height of three feet and it received a major ding.  Again, for the price these are okay but didn't work for our eager eaters and were eventually replaced with sturdier bowls.",4
1.0,Rash,"January 26, 2018",Yes,Bought this for my daughters dog and within a few days she had red spots all over belly. üòî how do I go about returning it since it was not good for the dog?,7
1.0,Bummed it doesn't work,"December 18, 2018",Yes,Doesn't reduce nor stop any barking. I put it on the most sensitive setting and I know it works but it hasn't made any difference with my dogs or my neighbors dogs,4
5.0,Five Stars,"January 30, 2016",Yes,FATHER IN LAW VERY PLEASED W/ BIRTHDAY GIFT!,25
5.0,Good Quality Deshedding Brush for the Money (and I have researched a bunch),"February 26, 2018",Yes,"Nice sized brush that comes with two metal brushing attachments (one longer than the other). It's of good quality too and comes in a nice prepacked box. I use this on my little rat terrier whose hair tends to get a little rough/thick on her back and around her neck and she actually sits still for the brushing and seems to like it (and she is usually fickle about getting brushed).  I haven't used it on any of the cats yet but would only use it on my fluffier cats.  The metal might be a little much for our older cats who are pretty skinny and have thinning hair.  I did use it on my one other short-haired dog and she was fine with the feel of it.  It was probably a good back-scratcher for her!..<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/TWOBIU-Pet-Deshedding-Brush-for-Dogs-Cats-Dog-Shedding-Brush-Cat-Deshedding-Tool-with-Fur-Ejector-Cat-Dog-Brushes-for-Shedding-Short-Hair-To-Medium-Length-Hair/dp/B01LZY3CHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TWOBIU Pet Deshedding Brush for Dogs &amp; Cats, Dog Shedding Brush, Cat Deshedding Tool with Fur Ejector, Cat &amp; Dog Brushes for Shedding Short Hair To Medium Length Hair</a>",1
5.0,Highly recommend!!,"January 10, 2019",Yes,"Amazing! My two outside dogs would always bark 24/7. When I come be go, during the night, if people were moving two houses down etc. I tried the collars but they didn‚Äôt seem to work and batteries were always dying. After a couple hours of hanging this bark house up the dogs were silent. They whine a little and let out a bark here and there but it‚Äôs nothing to the constant bark. I highly recommend them this!",3
4.0,Brushes well but some gadgets don't work.,"December 2, 2017",Yes,"It brushes well. My cats are iffy on this so far. They have no idea what I'm doing to them so they squirm around lol. My dog for the first time doesn't try and run away. She usually sits still after some time and then leaves. This time she stayed calm until I was done. A ton of fur came out, making her super soft. (She's a german shepherd mix.) The only downfall of this is there is supposed to be a release button to push the fur out. Well, doesn't really do anything. It's easy to pull the hair out myself so whatever. Also, to change the sizing of the brush it's hard to pull the blade out. I don't know if I'm not seeing an easy release or what.",2
4.0,Nice lightweight bowls for medium size dog,"June 18, 2016",Yes,"These are great bowls, lightweight and easy to clean.  They are not heavy duty bowls by any means, if your dog is tough on their dishes you might want to look elsewhere.  Our 52lb lab/pit mix seems to like them just fine.  We use about a cup and a half of dog food per meal and there is plenty of room.  They are shallow bowls though, when I fill one with water it is very easy to slop it out when carrying to spot where we keep her dishes.  I've taken to filling it often with a glass instead.  We keep them on a small carpet and they never slide around on that.  If they weren't on that though they would slide all over on our hardwood floors even with the small rubber ring on the bottom.  Our dog is able to drink just fine from the bowl and only slops a bit when she has been out tearing around the ranch and is drinking very quickly and panting heavily.",3
5.0,Highly Recommend !,"October 1, 2016",Yes,"I have been using Thunderpaws for a few months now. My 120 lb dog became acutely paralyzed 10 months ago. I work in wound care and know the importance of keeping the skin in tact, and in good condition,  to prevent bed sores, etc. I have been doing a lot of reading and found that the Omega vitamins were good for my dogs skin. Prior to his disability, he was prone to heavy shedding. In fact, I have never seen a dog shed so much. It would come out in handfuls. Since I have been using Thunderpaws, the shedding is very minimal. He likes the taste, which is a plus. He's very suspicious of everything and won't eat it until he makes sure it's okay (no medicine). I told him these were treats and I guess he believes me..haha! Most importantly, his skin is in good condition. His Vet looked at the ingredients and said they were good. I give him 4 (treats) a day. I probably should have these automatically delivered. However, I can get them by the next day if I need them. The company always sends them on time.",2
1.0,Didn't work,"December 18, 2018",Yes,"When I put the battery inside my dog was very scared of this, so I was pretty optimistic that she heard the beep, but to my dismay it didn't take her long before she was within the 50 foot zone and barking into the night :(",3
2.0,Serviceable but not impressive,"February 15, 2017",Yes,"This item just feels very light duty.  It does hold 32oz of liquid but that is right to the rim.  There is no margin at all for sloppy dog drinking when near full.  They felt so thin I went ahead and measured them.  The outside walls mic'ed at about 12 mil thick.  Pushing with a thumb will easily ""oil can"" the side walls.  The rubber skid band is also pretty thin (50-ish mils).  It's pretty soft and feels like it will wear through easily if scuffed around on a rough surface (as in by a dog eating/drinking).  My run-of-mill metal kitchen mixing bowls are much more substantial.  More of what I was expecting here only with a wide bottom.  Not what this item is. These are serviceable but not impressive.",2
5.0,Comfortable and Secure Leash!,"December 31, 2017",Yes,"I ordered this leash for our rescue when she turned one year old. I had previously had the same brand in the 8 foot length, but I wanted a shorter length and got the 6 foot. This is a wonderful leash! I especially like the padded hand loops which are easy on my hands when she sometimes pulls on me. The short loop is a life-saver when I want to keep her close to me for greater control. I am a senior and feel very secure walking my dog with this leash. The hardware on this leash is of good quality and can withstand  pulling when my dog spots a squirrel or deer. The 8 foot leash is great also, I just made a few knots in it to give me some more grip. I use the longer leash when my husband and I take our dog on wooded trails and I can give her a little more freedom. I had previously used a cloth leash that was slippery and would burn my hand if she suddenly pulled. No problems like that with this leash. Highly recommend!",1
1.0,Caution....Metal Residue,"January 18, 2017",Yes,"Poor quality stainless steel. When you leave dry dog food in this bowl for any length of time, as in just a few days, and wipe it with a damp paper towel, you will get a residue of gray metal. I sure as heck do not want to make my dog sick. Going back for a refund. And yes, I tried 2 different quality dry dog food brands and with the same results. Very disappointed.",4
5.0,Best Omega compound for pets!,"September 24, 2016",Yes,"I ""love It"" because my ca t needed Omega oils. He would scratch and practically 'ask' to have his back scratched daily and often.  There wasn't one oil style supplement I tried that he would eat mixed in his food. I take one tab and using a zester grate the tab into a fine powder, then mix into his food; he seems to love the enhanced smell and taste. Manufacturer mentions giving your pet a tab, but these tabs are the size of a US nickel and thick; grating them works best in my situation. If your cat/dog dislikes oily supplements, give these a try.",3
2.0,they are fine. Slightly smaller than I was expecting,"August 29, 2016",Yes,"For the price...they are fine..Slightly smaller than I was expecting, more wide than deep. Which makes mixing anything into my dogs 2 cups of kibble a bit more of a chore than it needs to be..Also one of the rubber rings around the base came broken, not a deal breaker but now I do find the bowl in different locations when I come home eat day. The dogs have figured out the bowls weakness and now exploit it whenever they get a chance. :/",4
2.0,"Overall, not worth it.","November 21, 2017",Yes,"If all you care about is something holding food and water I suppose they do that. However, they don‚Äôt stay weighted to the floor as advertised, and they got nasty very quickly. I purchased in feb but had a baby so I wasn‚Äôt able to write my review until now, so sorry. I guess I‚Äôm looking for new ones! My dog pushes her bowl all over the floor and the rubber piece on the bottom as come off. And the water bowl has rusted as well, so it looks really gross. Overall, not worth it.",2
5.0,Healthy and cat-approved!,"December 9, 2016",Yes,"Our cat hated the fish oil pills we were giving him, so we decided to try this product.  Our cat has always been a fussy eater, but he loves the taste of these. The dosage is half a pill daily.  We cut the pill in half and then crumble the half into smaller pieces.  He eats every bit.  Our vet looked at the ingredients and said this is just as good for our cat as the fish oil pills we used to have to force down his throat.  His coat is soft and silky, and he feels like he's getting a treat every day.  So our vet is happy, our cat is happy, and we're happy.  We'll definitely order more.",3
5.0,so far my dog has eaten the vitamins like a treat,"October 31, 2016",Yes,"so far my dog has eaten the vitamins like a treat.  trying to treat her hyperkeratosis.  i think its helping although its only been a week that shes been taking the pills.  i will say that the pills crumble easily, dont toss them to the dog or floor or you might need to do a little clean up.  the whole pill doesnt break apart, just the edges and i think the pills stink.  although ive always had to fight my dog to take pills so i guess ""stinky""  is a good smell to her",3
5.0,Very Satisfied,"March 29, 2016",Yes,"These came just as pictured with the embossed little paw prints and everything! It also came carefully packaged and both bowls were intact. I bought these for my puppy. He's a mini schnauzer and he is 11 weeks and he has no trouble eating from it. They're a great size too, you can even use it when your puppy gets older and bigger. The rubber part in the bottom prevents it from sliding on tile so no mess either unless your puppy happens to put his paw inside the water bowl (mine does it all the time). Overall, this was a great buy and would recommend to others!",3
2.0,Ineffective,"January 8, 2019",Yes,"I found this completely ineffective for my dog. He's an intact goldendoodle with a clear view from our back yard of a walking trail with several dogs and people that he has taken to barking at. When I tested it in the house, he seamed a little taken aback by it like he might have heard something. I tried it several different places in my backyard and gradually turned it to the highest setting. The light was signaling that it was working, but the barking never slowed. The final straw was after it was turned all the way up in one corner of the yard and he was standing directly under it barking very energetically. Returning it. I'll give it a couple stars since the return process is pretty painless.",1
4.0,"Works well, but shows the hard water stains more than other dishes","July 27, 2017",Yes,"I like these dishes well enough - they work fine and stand up to the play of multiple pets (including a large, muscular, rambunctious, full-sized/large ""puppy"").  The one minor complaint is we have extra hard water and these bowls seem to ""stain"" (hard water scaling residue) much more easily than any of our other pet bowls.",2
5.0,"Expensive, but well worth it if used right.","October 20, 2015",Yes,"Your dog will go bonkers for these. Ok, so they are expensive, there is no getting around that. But if you use them the right way they will last a long time. I use these as garnish treats. I sprinkle one over kibble and stuff them in the bottom of a Kong toy. The smell is an instant dog whistle. It's a strong smell but as long as you keep them sealed, you shouldn't smell it until opening. Want your dog to go in the crate? Put one of these in the crate, that simple. These are perfect for a busy body Chihuahua when you need to catch them or put them up. It's been about 5 months and I am getting just about to the bottom of this bag. Obviously a big dog owner will have a different experience, but if you use them as a stinky garnish, they will still last a long time.",1
4.0,Pet shedding driving you crazy? This inexpensive tool will change your life!!!,"June 27, 2018",Yes,"Recently adopted beautiful yellow Lab, he‚Äôs older and very sweet so had no problem with him being inside until we began noticing how much he sheds! Apparently everyone else knew this but since we were rescuing anyway it wouldn‚Äôt have changed our-all this to say I saw similar product advertised so we began searching our new amazon prime info There were so many to choose from we went with this brand because of price Honestly if I had known how it would change things I would have paid 3x the amount which was under $15.00 it is simple light silent &amp; doesn‚Äôt upset any dog we‚Äôve used it on which is fantastic only gave it 4out of 5 stars because I have nothing to compare it too this de-shedding tool is wonderful Thanks so much,T Lankford",0
4.0,My cats like this supplement,"October 7, 2016",Yes,"My cats like this supplement. I discovered my cats prefer smaller pieces. I cut the pill in 4 pieces, because my cats are small. In that way they love the pill, and I am very happy because they enjoy it. Their coats are soft..I would prefer if the pills were smaller or a different size for smaller animals.  It was very difficult to cut because the pill desintegrate..The seller was so kind. I am happy to find a supplement that my cats enjoy.",2
5.0,Itchy skin be gone = happy dog,"August 12, 2015",Yes,My dog has been suffering from itchy skin for the last few months‚Ä¶ nothing else I have tried seem to have any real impact until I used these Thunderpaws supplements and have started seeing significant changes. Before that the poor little guy was almost drawing blood from the constant scratching but I noticed significantly less scratching in the second week of use and he seems so much happier!.Theses treats are really tasty too and he definitely looks forward  to having them ‚Äì thinking of them as treats! Thank you so much for helping my dog,3
3.0,Not For Sloppy Drinkers or Food Wolfers,"March 20, 2016",Yes,"I was so excited for these bowls, based on their great reviews! Unfortunately, I felt a little let down. Here are my pros and cons:..Pros:.-Nonslip bottom is nice for slick floors.-They're very aesthetically pleasing to leave on your kitchen floor...Cons:.-The angles of the bowls make it easy for a dog to accidentally push food out with their nose..-If you have a dog that wolfs down food, the angles make it even easier for them to shovel food in their mouth. I had to put a few tuna cans in the food bowl to make it harder for my dog to shovel food down..-The angles of the bowl doesn't keep water inside. It sloshes around a lot more than a traditional bowl because these bowls are pretty shallow..-Water splashed around from dog lapping makes the nonstick rubber on the bottom worthless (both bowls will slide around on the puddle of water from excess water on the floor)..Overall: most of my problems with the bowls may have to do with the way my individual dog eats. I guess they work for now. But I'll probably find a different specialized bowl for my sloppy water drinker.",8
5.0,"Perfect size for a small dog, and not able to be moved/tipped!","April 1, 2017",Yes,"These are perfect for a small dog! With a small dog that doesn't eat much at one time, these are the perfect bowls. The best part is the rubber grips around the bottom which make it almost impossible for the dog to push them around/tilt them over. We take away water 2 hours before bedtime, and that is when we wash them out each night.",2
5.0,Brought back from the brink,"November 10, 2015",Yes,"We had been looking after a feral tabby Manx cat we have named ""Tommy"". Tommy stopped coming around for a couple of months and when he showed up again, he had lost weight and looked like he was on his last legs (he missing patches of fur and had some sort of scabby skin condition).  It broke my heart to see him in this state! We were afraid he wasn't going to make it through the next month, much less the coming winter, and decided to do our best to try get him back to good health. We started by putting him on a higher quality diet and adding these tablets to his meals (1/2 tab crumbled into each meal)...It's only been a little over a month now and Tommy not only looks like a different cat, but acts like one, too. He has put on weight, his fur is thick and shiny, and you can no longer feel any scabs on him when you pet him. He seems more alert and would now be mistaken for someone's pet, if it weren't for the fact that he was so skittish...I thought we were going to lose Tommy, but with good food and these tablets, he has made an amazing recovery in a very short period of time. I only wish I had taken a ""before"" photo, so that people could see what a change has been made, particularly in his skin and coat!",1
5.0,but I am happy to say that not only does the cat eat ...,"February 27, 2017",Yes,"I was hesitant to order this product for my fiance's fussy feline, but I am happy to say that not only does the cat eat the supplement without hesitation, he actually enjoys it. I've both noticed an improvement in his coat. I purchased because he was showing some signs of having dry skin/dander. There is still some dander, but he has been taking them for a little over a week.",2
5.0,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,"March 6, 2017",Yes,"Bought two sets.  Wish I bought a  5th bowl, or another pair so as to have a spare...I have five dogs.  Aside frombeing a bit hard to pickup off the floor, they work well  The rubber rim on the bottom keeps them from moving around.  They are easy to clean.  The bowl is a nice size for a doggie meal.",2
5.0,My dogs love it so far,"August 5, 2017",Yes,"My dogs love it so far. We are in the 5th day and seem to be working quite nice. I don't want to come early n say they work wonders but I've noticed their coat is looking shinier, the skin less flaky (some days in Chicago are very dry), and as a result they've stopped itching n scratching. I'm also giving them probiotics, so... let's see how it goes.... to be continued...",1
4.0,"Great for the price, but not perfect","May 13, 2016",Yes,For the price you can't really beat these bowls. They are stainless steel and are the perfect size for both our 50lbs and 90lbs dogs...The only complaint I would mention is that the rubber rings on the bottom are very thin and can slip off easily. Because they are thin it's not difficult for either of our dogs to still slide the bowls around the kitchen as they eat - though it certainly slows them down. Also one of our dogs was trained to pick up his bowl and present it to us before feeding but with these bowls if he picks it up the rubber ring almost always comes off because it is not glued to the bowl...Overall though definitely worth the price.,3
5.0,Works for cats!,"December 29, 2016",Yes,"These work. They have helped my cats' coat a great deal. I can see the difference in their fur- it is softer, much fuller and shinier. My cats love them. I give each half a treat per day, and I brake it into little pieces because they are big. This is the second jar I've bought, and will continue to give it to them. It didn't help much with dandruff, but I guess I can't have it all. I highly recommend them.",2
5.0,Great results.,"November 14, 2016",Yes,"This is the second bottle I've purchased of this product, and it works beautifully.  My 16 year old dachshund had horrible dull and patchy fur.  After using the Skin &amp; Coat product, his coat filled back in nice and shiny and the scratching/chewing stopped.  On a side note, I did try a similar product made by a different company, and the poor condition of the skin returned.  I'm now sold on this one product and will continue to purchase!",2
2.0,dinky bowls,"June 2, 2016",Yes,"This is very very lightweight stainless steel. The bowls do technically hold 32 oz but if you fill them, that much, they become impossible to put down without spilling. The rubber rings were coming off the bowls when they arrived, but they do not do much anyway, because they are made out of a slick material that does not grip the floor. I went to an unnameable store the other day and saw deep, heavyweight dog bows with grippy rubber for a little bit more. I wish I have been patient and purchased those.",1
1.0,the rubber at the bottom of these comes off so easily. Also - they are very shallow,"August 30, 2016",Yes,"I bought these bowls hoping that my dog, who always tries to tip her bowl over, would stop. Not only did they rust up after a week, the rubber at the bottom of these comes off so easily. Also - they are very shallow. I would suggest looking for a different product.",3
5.0,Awesome results,"September 5, 2016",Yes,My dog suffers from skin allergies ive tried it all no success. Then i got Thunderpaws omega chewable tablets and O.M.G i just 7 days his itching stopped and the redness went down!! Great product will refer to anyone. Plus my dog loves it he thinks its a treat..,3
5.0,Good results!,"February 13, 2017",Yes,"I've been using these for my two dogs for two months now.  I can honestly say I have noticed a positive result in both of my dogs...I was pleasantly surprised!  Their fur is soft, thick and flake free.  My only suggestion (someone else mentioned this too) is that they come in a smaller size so that you don't have to break them in half for a small dog.  They do not break well and tend to crumble.  I mix this in their food and they eat it, absolutely no problems with that issue.  One of my dogs is very allergic in the spring and fall.  I am hoping this helps with her itching during that time too.  I am reordering this product.",1
5.0,very good looking and very easy to clean,"February 25, 2016",Yes,"Completely impressed with this product for the price! I don't know what more you can want out of a dog bowl. They are large, very good looking and very easy to clean. My little GSD puppy would always walk up to a bowl of water or food and drag it with her, spilling the contents everywhere. However its nearly impossible to knock these bowls over or to slide them thanks to the rubber bottom so it makes no mess!",2
5.0,Nice dish,"March 2, 2017",Yes,"Nice dishes. A bit on the thin side, but what are you going to put in them beside dog food? They are light, but the rubber rim on the bottom helps keep them in place.",3
4.0,Great Treats,"March 8, 2017",Yes,"Love these as much as my dog does. He is addicted. They are great treats for your pocket as they do not leave any residue and are dry, but soft. It reminds me of space ice cream as a kid. Some of the chunks are perfect size (65 lb dog) but some bags I received are all super small pieces which can be difficult to give to him cleanly. Love the clean label and product!",1
2.0,Couldn‚Äôt get my cat to eat them,"June 3, 2018",Yes,"My cat has severe allergies, and we have to take him for steroid shots every few months because he literally scratches until he bleeds.  I was REALLY hoping these tablets would help control the itching, but I couldn‚Äôt get him to eat them.  I was really hopeful, because I saw so many reviews saying their picky pet ate them, but no luck for us.",0
1.0,NOT a winner,"September 16, 2016",Yes,Unfortunately the rubber has come off of the bottom of the bowl and rust developed underneath so I will not be buying this type of bowl again.,4
5.0,Great buy,"December 31, 2017",Yes,"Top quality leash and I love the extra handle that is close to the collar. That extra handle is why I purchased the collar. My dog does not have the best of manners yet and when I taken him to the vet, I need to have him right by my side with no chance of escape. He is secure in his harness and with the Two Handle dog leash by QOL.  The leash is also high quality, easy on the hands",0
5.0,My dog was super itchy...until I tried this product!,"July 14, 2017",Yes,"We got my dog as a rescue and he had MAJOR skin issues (ie. bald patches!) and he was super itchy. He scratched himself day and night. Although his skin healed with proper nutrition and care, he was still itchy. I tried Omega 3s, allergy medicine, coconut oil, etc. and nothing made a real difference. Then, a couple months ago, I tried Thunderpaws. Voila! My pup no longer scratches! When he sees the bottle, he immediately sits and stares at me...waiting to eat it. It's his favorite daily treat! I just ordered my second bottle and recently recommended it to a friend whose dog was having skin issues.",1
5.0,Great product for price!,"April 5, 2017",Yes,We left our fur baby's bowls at our daughters house and when we realized it we choose to buy these bowls from Amazon. They are very cute bowls and they are a good product for the price. My sheltie has no problem eating out of this bowl but if you have a collie with a long snouter it is a little more difficult for him but he loves his food so he has accommodated his snouter!,1
5.0,wont buy anything else,"June 8, 2015",Yes,"This is great! We had a little Yorkie show up on our doorstep a while back. He was wet, shivering and so matted we couldn't tell what sex he was.After a trip to the vet and groomer he was doing much better but continued to have sore spots on his skin assuming from the matted condition he had been in. I used this shampoo on him and immediately he was scratching less. I used it again a few days later and it soothed the little guy enough to stop scratching at his sores and now 2 weeks later they are completely gone and his coat is so soft and smells wonderful.",1
5.0,So good that I ordered another one,"November 15, 2017",Yes,"I saw a similar brush on FB.  I looked at the one advertised and other suggested similar brushes.  I found this one which seemed almost identical and found it was cheaper than the initial one I looked for.  I bought it, used it and liked it so much that within the week I ordered a second one and referred another person suggesting they order one too.  If you're reading this, get one! I'm sure you'll be satisfied with your selection.",1

4.0,No More Scratching.,"February 10, 2017",Yes,"The scratching and itching has stopped for all intents and purposes. Still sheds like bigfoot. I sweep up a puppy's worth every day.  Absolutely no problem getting him to eat it, (Or anything else for that matter)..He will take it right out of my hand. It breaks up really easily..I find the cost a bit much, but not as bothersome as the scratching.",1
5.0,I am beyond EXCITED to see the difference this makes in their dry skin especially with winter coming quickly and I know our poor,"October 31, 2016",Yes,"Both my dogs, the 14 year old Shih Tzu and the 5 month old Shih Tzu gobbled them up!  They both received half.  I can't wait to see a change in their skin and coat as the 14 year old has been dealing with some awful, smelly, dry and itchy skin for months now!  I wish I had learned of these some time back as I feel he would not have had to suffer as much for so long!!!  I am beyond EXCITED to see the difference this makes in their dry skin especially with winter coming quickly and I know our poor Rascal (the 14 yr old) is ready for some relief!!!.These must taste pretty awesome too because the 14 yr old is very finicky!!!!.Thank you Thunderpaws!!!!!!!",2
5.0,But they are picky so I was pleasantly surprised when they like the taste of these,"March 9, 2018",Yes,"two old cats could use a little extra TLC.  But they are picky so I was pleasantly surprised when they like the taste of these. I take a fourth tablet and for each, then crush them with the flat edge of a broad cooking knife, then scrape the 'dust' onto their plates of canned food. They love the taste. Just started using them, so don't know what the results will be.  But just to help their appetites is a good start.",0
5.0,... that my picky 15 year old cocker spaniel would hate these and I was going to have to crush ...,"December 21, 2017",Yes,I was worried at first that my picky 15 year old cocker spaniel would hate these and I was going to have to crush them up in her food some how. She gobbled them up like they were a treat. Our cat is not as picky but she is a cat after all. She has FeLv though and needs any help she can get. She also loved them though I break it up into quarters for her. So far I have noticed a difference in their coats and their energy level.,0
5.0,Great quality!,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"My dogs tend to pull when they walk and the leash I had always hurt my hand.  And if I wanted to have short leash I would wrap the leash around my hand - Ouch!  I bought this leash to try out the padded handle with the second handle just a bonus.  I love it!  It is so much easier on my hand and the length is good.  The second handle is very useful when needing a bit more control.  I liked it so much, the next day I ordered another one.üòÄ",0
3.0,Too little for my 40 and 90 lb.r,"April 12, 2016",Yes,I thought 32 oz. Would be a pretty big size. I have to refill my 90lb. Dog food 2x and my 40lb. Dog food bowl 1 1/2x  .....do you make a larger bowl.  I like the bowl because my 90lb.r throws her food bowl around  (what a mess) and tries to toss her water bowl....please let me know if you have bigger bowls....otherwise I need to return and look at Pet smart or something...hopefully you can help,2
5.0,The cat is finally relaxed again! No more biting/itching,"August 7, 2017",Yes,"My cat had been scratching non-stop for about two weeks.  Finally realized it wasnt fleas or allergies but dry skin..So far, 4th day, she has been much more relaxed and the area is healing already. These pills really work &amp; that's only giving the cat 1/2 pill daily.",1
5.0,Our 10 year old cat has been eating plastic and ...,"May 21, 2017",Yes,Our 10 year old cat has been eating plastic and throwing up afterward. We tried different kinds of vitamins before but she refuse to eat them. She loves this product from the first time we gave it to her. Now she's been asking for the vitamins every day. We will have to see if that stops her habit.,1
5.0,My cat's skin condition healed very quickly!,"March 10, 2017",Yes,"Recently I adopted a cat with severe flea allergy. She had horrible scabs all over hear body, and it took her a while to recover, so I decided to give this tablet a try. It seems to help her heal quicker. Now her skin is all nicely healed up and her fur is so shiny soft!  The tablet is so easy to break down so I crumble it into her food dish and she just eats it with cat food. She seems to like the flavor too, and my dog also loves this tablet as well and tries to steal it from her all the time!",2
5.0,Cat Likes Them,"May 10, 2018",Yes,"My cat -- who isn't the biggest eater -- just had her first tablet. Subsequently, I find her sifting through the trash licking the cotton that I threw away from the bottle. Perfect because I am using this treat as a training device and now I can manipulate my hard-to-manipulate cat.",0
5.0,Love it!,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"This brush is AMAZING!!!! Everytime I use it I get a giant ball of fur! My cat also seems to not hate it! I love the button feature to push out the fur, it really helps do the process quicker. I haven't use the furminator and I never will for the ridiculous price, but I think anyone looking for a deshedding brush similar to that one will be very happy with this one.",0
5.0,My Dog Likes These,"December 6, 2016",Yes,"My main motivation for trying this was that I have a very picky Labrador. He won't eat the usual fish oil capsules. He does eat these which is the basis for my rating. However, it would be nice to know how much omega-3,-6, and -9 oils is in each chewable tablet.  .7% doesn't really tell me anything.  .7% of what?",1
5.0,I've never seen dogs so excited about treats,"August 16, 2015",Yes,"I have two extremely spoiled 8 month old Rottweiler pups. To say they are stubborn is an understatement. I am always on the look-out for good,healthy treats to help with their training. All the reviews were so fantastic I just had to let my dogs try them. From the moment I gave them their first treat I had my boys in the palm of my hand - I am not exaggerating at all. They followed me around so excited to work on commands. I'm not going to have perfectly trained dogs because of these treats but they absolutely love them and that's all that matters to me.",0
5.0,Got my yard back within 24 hours,"January 13, 2019",Yes,"Within 24 hours of putting this device about a foot off the ground, right at the fence where my neighbors dogs barked incessantly- we were rewarded with silence. My dog will still bark one time to get inside, so it cannot be that bad for the animals... keep a fresh 9v battery in it, and go straight to the highest setting.",0
4.0,I do like that it took a lot of the fur from ...,"March 10, 2018",Yes,"I have mixed feelings about this product. My cats cried the entire time I was combing their hair. Not sure if this was pulling on them as it deshedded them. I do like that it took a lot of the fur from them, but I‚Äôm not sure if I want to do this again. I would like to know if it hurts them.",0
5.0,I didn't like them as much as my dog.,"March 7, 2017",Yes,"I'll be straight; I bought these thinking they were a chicken snack.  After the first four or five handfuls, I read the package and learned they are meant for dogs.  My dog will do absolutely anything for these treats.",2
5.0,Kitty loves it!,"October 29, 2017",Yes,Love this company and the vitamins. They answered my question saying there is no phosphorus in the vitamin. Low phosphorus is necessary for a CKD cat. My very picky eater will gobble them down when mixed in with his dry food. He is thriving now and perhaps these vitamins are helping.,1
5.0,"I love it, it came on time and it's perfect ...","January 30, 2018",Yes,"I love it, it came on time and it's perfect for my pug. This brush is not as well as another one I had but it still works well. This works best on small dogs and medium too. I tried to use it on a friends golden retriever but it would have taken too long because of the brushes size but if you have the time it works very well.",0
5.0,Great quality. Love two-handle concept!,"August 2, 2018",Yes,Our puppy is 45-50 lbs. The leash is of a very good quality and easy to buckle! It also reflects light at night very well. Perfect for a city dog! I love the two-handle concept and am definitely using either handle depending on which one fits the situation.,0
5.0,"My fur babies(cats) love these, they think they are treats","December 27, 2017",Yes,"My fur babies(cats) love these, they think they are treats. I have noticed a change in their coats, it is silky, no more little bumps by the tail,I recommend  this for skin issues, and clumping hair,",1
4.0,"Good, but not great.","October 19, 2015",Yes,"This shampoo was for my Westie that has bad allergies. We loved the other shampoo that we'd been using for years, but the price was raised, so thought it was time to try something new. The smell wasn't bad, I liked the natural ingredients. However, we did end up spending the extra money and going back to the other shampoo. This just didn't seem to last as long. We ended up having to give the dog a bath every two or three days instead of weekly. The scent just didn't stay. But I think for some it could be a good product.",0
5.0,This is great at removing the under coat of my German Shorthaired ...,"July 17, 2017",Yes,This is great at removing the under coat of my German Shorthaired Pointer. She loves it and will stay still long enough to brush her entire body out.  She'd never stay still that long with other brushes.,2
5.0,I love this shampoo,"March 19, 2015",Yes,"I love this shampoo. But that's not important. My precious long and short haired Dachshunds seem to enjoy because the lather feels good to them and the formula rinses off easily. Doesn't stick to their coat. Reasonably priced. Don't need much to get the job done. Leaves their sensitive skin feeling much less irritated and their coat has more luster. Easy to take a brush to, no tangles. Has a subtle fragrance but not per-fumy. Will continue to use. Would recommend.",1
5.0,"Great product, great company","August 15, 2016",Yes,"Okay, so these tablets didn't work out for my cats only because my fussy kitties refused to eat them, but I'm still rating 5 stars because the quality is excellent...I also have to credit the company for its dedication to their product and customer service -- they definitely stand out.  And, true to the 100% Satisfaction Guarantee my  purchase was refunded and email exchanges were very pleasant..(Although I'd rather have had my cats eat the tablets.)..So, if you're on the fence about purchasing because you're not sure your pet will like the taste, you can at least feel comfortable knowing the company does stand behind their product.",6
4.0,Nice tool.,"August 26, 2017",Yes,"I really like how these work on my Parson Terrier, and the 2 sizes are great, but the button to clean the blades doesn't really do much so I need to clean them by hand thus I'm taking off one star.",1
5.0,Excellent!!!,"July 15, 2017",Yes,"Received it and immediately used it on our dog. Let me say it was exactly as advertised. I removed so much dead hair, that I was shocked. No discomfort to our dog while using it. This is a pet lovers must have.",1
5.0,I didn't think this was possible but I could brush his chest/stomach as he stood and the dander fell like snow! Never mind vacuu,"June 27, 2016",Yes,So I am raising my 4th golden retriever in my life now. I have never had one with any skin or coat issues. This guy has always shed double the amount of my other dogs. I know you thinking its a retriever they all shed. This one is different. His coat is shiny already and soft. The bigger problem was dander. I didn't think this was possible but I could brush his chest/stomach as he stood and the dander fell like snow! Never mind vacuuming! That had to be every other day! I tried bathing more often and not as often long story short after 3wks now I do not have to brush him every other day anymore. Also the dander has stopped!  His underside seemed worse but anytime you moved his hair apart you could see the skin flaking everyday of every month. The 1st 6-9months he didn't but he did shed a lot. I would def buy this product for coat and skin issues!,0
3.0,Perhaps best for smaller dogs?,"May 14, 2018",Yes,"It works.. sorta. I have two large German Shepherd and once I go over 2 brush strokes, I have to empty the hair out. This makes the process long and tedious. I need a brush which holds more hair, and I can do more than 2 brush strokes before having to clean it.",0
1.0,Smell is not nice.,"December 26, 2015",Yes,I will be returning.  Smell was off-putting and product did not leave dogs hair as soft as other products.  Smell is not nice.,5
3.0,"short teeth, but a good deshedder","January 17, 2018",Yes,"this has very short teeth - we have a beagle and it does okay, but I think a longer tooth deshedding brush would have worked better for our little guy",1
5.0,My boxer eats these tablets like treats,"November 19, 2015",Yes,"My vet wanted my boxer on omega's due to a kidney issue. I tried many different omega capsules, even from the vet, mixing the oil into his food. He just doesn't like anything fishy. During my search I found these tablets and they just work for him. What a relief to find something that I don't have to struggle to get down. Fast shipping, well made product, would recommend to others.",1
5.0,Adorable imprinted paw prints on the sides,"March 19, 2016",Yes,"Received and was pleasantly surprised by the durability and secure rubber ""no skid"" bottom ring. Attractive shiny stainless steel which our shelter rescue immediately approached &amp; drank her water.  No introduction period needed as was ""ok-ed"" by ""the sniff test"" and immediately used. Adorable imprinted paw prints on the sides. Pleased with this purchase, although the size is larger than expected. But that was our call; nothing to do with the product itself. Would recommend.",1

4.0,Omega 3 tablet my kiddos actually eat without hesitation!,"October 25, 2015",Yes,"I rate it a four because I have not used it long enough to see a difference in my dogs; however, I can say that despite the tablets not being my preferred 'soft chew' for my dogs, my dogs eat them without hesitation.  Unlike other capsule Omega 3's that I have to hide in cheese or the liquid forms that my kiddos just will not eat, they don't hesitate to eat the Thunderpaws tablets...Also, Thundarpaws customer service is beyond exceptional in my experience.  I am optimistic that I will see a difference in my kiddos skin, cost and overall well being!",0
4.0,Works very well,"May 3, 2018",Yes,"My cats and dogs like this deshedder. They line up waiting to be brushed. I have used it on my cats , long and short hair, as well as my dogs.  The only problem is have is that it works so well that I have to clean it out constantly!  Easy to clean though.  I‚Äôd buy it again as I have five dogs and four cats....and lots of hair is shed.",0
5.0,Great....,"July 14, 2017",Yes,Great bowls. I had a water/food combo bowl but my beagle liked to paw at it and flip it over. There'd always be water on the floor üòÅ She can't flip these and they just look like nicer too.,1

Shouldn't be too much of a problem though, I don't think.  We have large dogs.",1
5.0,really like this product,"October 11, 2016",Yes,"my old dog gets one tablet every morning and it makes a big difference! Before she was sleeping a lot, not interested in anything. Now she is funny again, playing and barking!",2
5.0,Great treats,"April 22, 2018",Yes,I have bought this many times for my dogs. They love the treats and if you look at the ingredients it can't get better than that. Easy to eat for them and easy to break for the larger chunks. Great for training any dog!,0
4.0,My beagle loves them (and he is picky!),"October 30, 2015",Yes,My dog loves these treats and so far so good with not getting sick or anything - they're a great treat and I like knowing that they're all natural and I'm not giving him anything that could hurt him. My only negative comment would be that some of the pieces are really tiny - I realize this can't really be helped though and so I just give him a few tiny pieces at a time instead of one big one.  Overall - really good product and I would purchase again!,0
2.0,Cute but too shallow.,"May 9, 2017",Yes,These are cute bowls but it never stated anywhere how deep they are. I returned them because they were way too shallow and my Golden Retriever puppy would have sent food and water everywhere in short order!,1
5.0,Great cost for good looking and functional bowls.,"April 18, 2018",Yes,Work well and look nice. Pricing was a bonus. Our dog eats about 2 cups of food at a time and this is about the perfect size for the serving. If we had to feed a larger amount we would want to get larger bowls.,0
4.0,Great for the Price,"December 19, 2016",Yes,They're great for the price.  They are super easy to clean which keeps the water nice and fresh.  I'm still on the hunt for some with larger capacity.  I use them as water bowels and between my cat and dog I sometimes need to refill them twice a day.,1

I have a small dog so the food bowl is kinda too big (her food only takes up a small portion of the bowl), but I'm using it anyway. I use the other one for water and it's perfect. Very nice looking and they don't slide around the floor.",1
5.0,Love IT!!!,"August 28, 2017",Yes,"I have a Basset Hound, and when it's HOT the hair is all over. I like it better than stripping comb I had, because it holds the hair in the comb and not in the Air.",1
4.0,This is a great product at half the price of the Furminator,"April 19, 2018",Yes,"This is a great product at half the price of the Furminator. Seems sturdy and works well for my Swissie's undercoat.  Not 5 stars, because the IDEA of a fur ejector is great, but it really doesn't work because the fur sticks to it. (the more expensive one didn't, either, and the handle broke).",0
4.0,"Brushes great, but ejector doesn't work.","December 5, 2017",Yes,Brush works well in untangling and getting rid of the excess fur. Makes my dogs fur so soft and luxurious. Nice handle with good grip. It loses a star because the ejector tool does not work. It does not push the fur out of the tines. Fur stays stuck and you have to remove it with your hands.,0
4.0,Nice product.,"October 13, 2016",Yes,"Nice product.  Not a full supplement, but it works for the dog's coat.",3
5.0,Non-slip is key!,"August 3, 2016",Yes,"Great product. Doesn't slip at all on our hardwood floors, easy to clean, and low enough to the ground for our 9 week old puppy to easily access. I will note that we've had to catch her from napping with her ear in the water bowl (weird), so if your dog is a big water fan, consider getting a set of raised bowls.",1
1.0,really doesnt do the job,"January 7, 2019",Yes,I bought this as a first round way to keep dogs from barking.  while it does flash a light and presumably emits a sound... it really doesn't deter the dogs.  I'd suggest looking at bark collars rather than spending money on this.,0
5.0,Great Deal!  Perfect for medium dogs!,"April 14, 2016",Yes,"Pretty nice, especially considering the price, at Petco something comparable would be double the price.  They're a little small for my 75 pound german shepherd and a little too big for my corgi-mix, but the big dog always finishes the smaller one's leftovers anyway so it works out.",1
5.0,Dumb humans) that they hadn't been scratching after a couple ...,"April 22, 2017",Yes,"The chews work. Tried 'em for a month on our two hounds, then forgot to re-order. Dogs started scratching again, which is when we realized (DUH! Dumb humans) that they hadn't been scratching after a couple of weeks on the supplement. These chews are rather powdery, but our boys don't care. They gulp 'em down like treats.",0

This tool really gets in there and pulls out the loose hair and holds on to it so that it doesn't end up on the floor. I've tried many tools like this and this is by far the best. Comes with a smaller attachment brush too. After using this, her coat is so soft and shiny. Love it!",0
5.0,Great Product,"April 17, 2017",Yes,"This is a Great product. We rescued a 7 year old dog just before Christmas. His hair was so thin you could see his skin. After about six week of taking the Omega 3,6 &amp;9 he looks great. He also loves to take them. Thanks",1

5.0,Love these bowls,"April 7, 2017",Yes,Love these bowls! They're the perfect size for our medium lab mix and don't slide around. I like that the rubber piece on the bottom is removable for easy washing but stays put when on. Best price for 2!,1
1.0,Waste of money,"January 16, 2019",Yes,Waste of money!! It does not stop my dog at all!! I know it works cause when she barks the red light is on..dont buy!!!!,0
2.0,Will buy different ones next time,"April 1, 2018",Yes,hhmm they rust very quickly. I've had stainless steel bowls for years with no issues just thought they had their best time. These ones I've only had for a short period of time and rust spots are noticeable on the outer rims. Won't buy again.,0
3.0,You get what you pay for...,"October 3, 2017",Yes,"These are fine bowls for a temporary or cheap fix. I don't particularly care for how narrow they're, and wish they were slightly deeper. They have done OK in the meantime, but I wouldn't keep them forever. The quality matches what you pay for.",1

3.0,just okay,"May 7, 2017",Yes,overall still functional and you can't necessarily beat the price but the rubber liner has come off of both of them and that makes them pretty noisy now :(,2

I still use them without the rubber bottom but now they slide a lot easier on the floor.,1
3.0,A good deal but definitely not anti-skid,"July 6, 2016",Yes,"A good deal but definitely not anti-skid. I even keep them on a silicone mat for double antiskid and they still move when my dogs scratch at them for food. But they're big, have cute bones on the sides and are a pretty good deal for two.",1
5.0,Doggie Healthy Too,"October 26, 2015",Yes,"Ok, so far I am totally pleased with this product.  I love that it's scored so that it's easier to break for a small 5# dog.  It seems to.be keeping her coat shiny.  I'm hoping that it will also help some with the small amount of shedding she has; but it's been too soon.to respond on that.  Either way I'd suggest to Family/Friends as I have not seen any side affects.",0
5.0,Amazing results,"September 17, 2016",Yes,"My dog (Am Staff Terrier) has really sensitive skin. Every year, for about 6 months, she battles with extremely itchy skin and scratches until the point of having scabs everywhere. We have tried everything including some OTC vitamins, anti-itch medication, allergy medication, medicated shampoo and constant use of anti-itch sprays and nothing has really worked beyond 5 minutes. I got fed up and started looking for another product to try and I came across the Thunderpaws chewables and thought it couldn't hurt. We coupled the 1 chewable with a medicated spray and it didn't take long to notice a difference...On day 2 we noticed she was still scratching but it wasn't non stop. On day 3 we noticed that we made it through the whole day without telling her to stop. By day 4 the itching was almost non-existent and all of us were sleeping through the night (it had been months of being disturbed by the violent scratching). We are a week into it now and I feel confident in saying that this product has saved my entire family's sanity...Now, for those that are worried about the chewable being ""medicine"", it's really not. My dog finds a pill in anything you try to hide it in and makes sure to eat around it or spit it out so I was a little concerned about her taking it. I initially called it a treat and she reluctantly took it. She ate it no problem. However, after that, the dog went crazy for it. I'm not even sure she chews it at this point. Every morning she runs to the kitchen and sits in her spot waiting for me to get it.",6

I still use them both, but had to put down a mat so the one missing the rubber on the bottom didn't slide all over the hardwood floor.

She was also scratching a lot around the collar area. The shampoo seemed to eradicate most of the dandruff problem, and she smelled fresher, too! I did not notice any irritating qualities, it lathers up nicely, and it appears to be mostly fragrance free. She still had a slight dog odor, but not bad. I used cool water and only lathered her up once. I have no experience with dogs, so maybe I should lather rinse and repeat next time. This Omega dog shampoo seems like a good value, and not full of chemicals.",0

4.0,Nice smell and lather,"July 5, 2015",Yes,"I bought this shampoo as a last effort to give my yorkie-poo some relief from constant itching. This smell is nice and it lathers up nicely. Her coat was fluffy and felt clean. However, there was no relief from itching. I didn't expect miracles, but was hopeful that she would get some relief. I would buy this shampoo again for the other qualities I mentioned previously.",0
3.0,OK for fuzz.,"February 19, 2018",Yes,The stainless steel shedding blades work much better in my opinion. At least for Labs who shed ALL The time. This doesn't seem to grab as much hair.,0

5.0,but they loved the attention and got used to it quickly,"December 22, 2017",Yes,"THIS IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  I have 3 dogs, and the hair is overwhelming.  The first time I used it I would tell this would DRASTICALLY reduce the shedding in our home.  All of our dogs are short haired, I'm not sure how this would work with thicker coats (?), but was prefect for our 4 legged friends.  They were a little apprehensive at first as we have never ""groomed"" them, but they loved the attention and got used to it quickly, this will become a weekly ritual at our home.",0
5.0,Dogs loved it!,"September 7, 2015",Yes,The liver treats came timely and well packaged.  I have a 7 month old puppy and a 7 year old performance dog.  I go through a lot of treats in a short period of time.  I like that these have no additives and are pure liver so are good for the dogs.  The pieces are small and dry so no gumming up my pockets.  The pieces can even be broken up so they stretch even farther.  The bag is large and full so it will last more than a week. The dogs come running when they hear the bag opening.  I will definitely order these again!,0
5.0,Great Stainless Bowls,"March 24, 2017",Yes,"Love these bowls.  They are lightweight, but have the rubber around the bottom so they don't slide easily.  Easy to clean.",1
5.0,Very effective,"April 22, 2018",Yes,"The thing is fantastic. I didn't think so when I first looked at it out of the box, but once you learn how to use it right, watch the hair come out . It does a very good job of removing loose hair both undercoat and outer coat.",0

3.0,"Worth it for the price, but the capacity is smaller than I thought","January 14, 2017",Yes,"Cheap but they'll work. The actual bowl itself is smaller that I would have imagined but the product is huge, seems like a waste of space.",1
4.0,It works with all of them and they like to be brushed,"August 8, 2017",Yes,This brush works very well. I have three dogs with different types of fur. It works with all of them and they like to be brushed. The fur ejector works fairly well and is easy to use. Love the product!,0

4.0,"Much different look than previous bag, but still good","October 13, 2015",Yes,"I have bought these treats before they changed the processing...my dogs still love them but the look is not nearly as inviting as before the change.  I even called the manufacturer to make sure the treats were good despite the over freeze dried appearance.  I was assured they are using the same ingredients that just the cosmetics have changed. My bag came with about 1000 small pieces too...maybe exaggerating a bit but the treats seem to have crumbled in the bag.  I will buy again with hopes there is a bit more consistency to the size and I wish they would have stayed with the other processing company.  The ""new"" look really isn't appealing but my dogs LOVE them.",0
5.0,My dogs love it!,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"I own two Shiba Inu puppies and they both love to be combed with this wonderful comb, particularly during the period of heavy shedding. I would recommend it anytime.",0
4.0,Good set of bowls,"March 26, 2017",Yes,"Good quality set of bowls.  The rubber around the bottom is very nice.  I wish the steel were a bit thicker for more 'heft' in the hand, but at the price this is a deal that can't be beat.  I recommend.",1
5.0,Best smelling shampoo!,"September 23, 2017",Yes,Great shampoo. Very gentle and leaves my pup smelling fresh for a week or more. Only takes a small amount to get my Boxador shiny and soft. I think she enjoys the lather too!,0

I purchased this product because of,"October 6, 2015",Yes,I have been looking for a product for my two cats but especially for Max. He's  fussy guy with a bum back knee. He only likes crunch and it was difficult to find something that crunched and he would like. I purchased this product because of the ingredients and thought it was well worth the chance that he would take it. Much to my surprise and relief he chowed down and was looking for more. It has only been about a week but I see him walking better and is more active. I also like that it is made in the USA.  Thank you for a great product from a relieved cat and cat mom.,1

5.0,These bowls are just perfect for my growing husky,"April 26, 2016",Yes,"These bowls are just perfect for my growing husky. Though she can't manage to get all four of her paws into it, she still tries. At least it doesn't go skittering across the floor in her attempts.",1
5.0,Great Value,"July 18, 2015",Yes,Our puppy's first encounter with freeze dried treats was at the Veterinarian.  She loves them so much that we decided to try them.

5.0,BEST oatmeal shampoo!,"June 15, 2015",Yes,"My German Shepherd has extremely dry and itchy skin.  I cringed whenever I bathed her because all of the dog shampoos I've tried (there were many) were too rough and left her fur covered with white flakes, which made her skin condition even worse.  I was told to try oatmeal shampoo to help my dog.  There are lots of oatmeal shampoos on the market, but I really liked this one after reading the ingredients.  This shampoo is a winner!  If you take a close look, you can even see the huge chunks of aloe in the bottle.  Its very, very, very gentle.  No more white flakes!  It even helped with her itchiness and leaves her fur feeling super smooth and silky.  and yes, it gets the dirt out too!",0
4.0,It's not like she instantly stopped scratching after its first,"January 12, 2017",Yes,"Oops, I accidently rated this product two stars.  Just want to revisit to say I meant to rate it four stars.  The only reason I'm not giving it a five is because I think I need to use it on my Bichon-Coton a few times before I say it's a five.  It's not like she instantly stopped scratching after its first, and so far only, use.",0
5.0,Happy fur babies!!,"December 22, 2016",Yes,After using this shampoo my fur babies have almost stopped scratching and that is just one use. I feel that after another bath their skin and coat will be back to the normal state. It has a nice smell and works well.,0

He had a very bad dandruff problem and the hot dry climate I'm sure wasn't helping.  This shampoo in combination with All Natural Grizzly Salmon Oil solved his dandruff problem with in a few weeks.

The bowls are wide but very shallow. They hold maybe two cups each, and even then the food or water is easily pushed over the edges once my dog begins to eat or drink.

5.0,Great smelling shampoo - best I have found on the market,"August 11, 2015",Yes,"It smells great (vanilla). So far it is the best shampoo that I have found for my itchy dog. I got a tip from my vet. I wash my dog quickly with Dawn dishwashing detergent to get rid of oils and then rinse her. Then I use the Omega shampoo which works better after the Dawn prewash. I keep the shampoo on her skin and wrap her in a dry towel. I hold her on my lap for 15 mins while the shampoo gets into her skin more. Then I rinse her and dry her. I no longer use a hair dryer, I just use lots of towels. Generally wash her at night before bedtime so she doesn't go outside for walks in the cold anymore except for a quick dash before bed. Leaving the shampoo on her let's the oatmeal work it's way into her skin and I think this process helps the itching issue a lot.",4

The bowl is angled in a just such a way that the water spills right out the other side when you fill it.  It also splashes out if you move the bowl even a tiny amount.  Just fine for food, though.",1
5.0,Works good on German Shepherd,"January 11, 2018",Yes,I bought this brush for my German Shepherd. It works good. The extra small one was a nice addition,0

He has dry itchy skin and he has totally changed. He‚Äôs not scratching all the time, and his coat is so soft and smooth! And I found out I can‚Äôt leave the other half of the pill out on the counter ....... he really likes them!! Thank you so much",0
3.0,"Looks great, only works ok.","March 9, 2016",Yes,"Works great for food, but the water spills out every time either of my dogs goes for a drink. I have a Yorkshire Terrier and a Great Pyrenees. For water, one of these bowls should be deeper and have a harder angle so the water doesn't splash out so easily.",1
5.0,A must have for large active dogs,"October 26, 2017",Yes,"If you're planning to walk multiple dogs, this is a must have with your dual bungee type leash coupler. DO NOT use anything more than a dual coupler, no matter what the company promises as ""tangle free"". It don't exist beyond a dual...We have medium (30lbs+) and large dogs (60lbs+). We are active, and so are our dogs. We walk our neighbors' dogs for health and disciplinary reasons. This gives us a 1.5ft + (length of the coupler)ft from the first handle loop. LOVE IT! Perfect length to present to other walkers that we have the dog walkers that our dogs are close to us. Our dogs are well disciplined and trained, but the visual display provided comforts and security to other walkers...We've tested on our GSD (~90lbs), coupled up with wild huskies (~90lbs).There was no weak link for the the leash. The only weak link may be ""tangle free"" coupler. So far, after months of walking, while dealing with ultra high energy large dogs, the leash is nothing but a god-sent. I'm glad I spent a bit of extra money to get this leash, with a bit of loop padding, to deal with tugging dogs. Imagine a poly line's edges dig into your skin, causing rope burns. Got plenty of those until this little beauty...Easy to clean up, using warm water and Dawn dish soap. Handwash in 3 minutes (soak 15 minutes if it went through the mud), air dry in 3 hours, and ready to roll for the next walk.",1
5.0,Good quality leash,"March 12, 2018",Yes,Appears to be very well made and sturdy. Shipped quickly and arrived on time.,0

2.0,Shallow,"May 24, 2016",Yes,"These do not hold 32 ozs. Shallowness of the dish makes it less functional, and non-skid ring easily came off when our puppy gets a hold of it.",1

5.0,Good product,"January 2, 2017",Yes,My dog loves them. Only downside is that amount of treats you can give them is limited. No more than 3 or 4 per day. Because I was purchasing them for training purpose.,0
3.0,Not as big as expected. It says it holds ...,"April 7, 2016",Yes,Not as big as expected . It says it holds 32oz but that's if it's piled high above the rim. I can fit only about 2 cups until it starts to over flow.,1

3.0,Would have given 5 stars BUT they changed them!!! :(,"October 9, 2015",Yes,"Would have rated 5 stars but.......My dogs loved them and I also used to be able to easily grind them down into a powder to sprinkle on their food when they were being picky about eating. This helped tremendously, especially for my diabetic dog who HAS to eat. Unfortunately, I had to downgrade to 3 stars because most recent bag was ""diced"" not formed. I had no clue they had changed until I got the bag and was VERY SURPRISED. Now I see the sentence at the very bottom of the description saying they changed them,my unfortunately, most people don't read the description every time they order something they order regularly...The new treats are tiny compared to the old ones, Some are mere crumbs. They do not grind down well into a powder like the old ones used to and I have very big dogs, so to even use them as a regular treat, would be just a tease. They don't seem to like them as much as the old version either. They almost seem a slightly different texture. They might work ok for smaller dogs...While I was a repeat customer, I am not sure I will be ordering these anymore now that they have changed them, I just can't justify paying this price for a bag that's half the size of the old one (still weighs the same) when Hal the bag is essentially crumbs and even as crumbs, they still don't grind down as well into the fine powder I use to sprinkle on food if needed. If I wasn't disabled, making getting to the post office difficult, I may have actually returned this bag...I'll keep an eye on the product to see if they ever decide to offer the old version again,",2

5.0,"Good quality, easy to dose and the dogs like them.","August 29, 2015",Yes,"These arrived quickly and in good condition.  The tablets break easily for smaller dogs, and appear to taste good as the dogs practically inhaled them.  An easy way to dose quality omegas without dealing with snipping the ends of gel caps to squirt on food.",0
5.0,I'd recommend,"March 7, 2017",Yes,So far great set! Good quality stainless steel bowls with rubber trim for non skid. Good weight to them.  Nice paw designs around. Just like the pics. I'd recommend.,1

4.0,Great dog snack,"December 27, 2015",Yes,"I like that I know I am giving a healthy snack to my Pom.  She didn't care for it at first, but got to appreciate the taste soon after.  She likes how it smells too. She begs and does tricks just to get one. I took away 1 star because I think it crumbles easily. I have to cut it to small pieces sometimes since my dog is little.",0
4.0,Four Stars,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"Took a few weeks, but seems to have improved the skin and coat of our furkids.",0

Maybe a little TOO well, actually -- as my cats have become entirely obsessed with it.  I purchased this as a source of amusement for my cats and I gotta say they absolutely adore it.  Birds are flocking to it and the cats watch from inside the safety of the house for hours and hours.  Even at night they still sit and watch and wait, hoping for some elusive night bird to swoop down into their sites.  Eventually I just have to close the curtain and say to my disappointed cat audience ""Sorry, show's over for tonight. Come back tomorrow!""..As far as the feeder itself, it has been performing like a champ.  Suction cups hold it securely in place and have successfully supported anywhere from 1-6 birds at once.  Weather says warm out here year round, so I don't know how it would perform in the cold/snow.  Removable seed tray is easy to take off and refill in seconds.  I like the clean, simple, functional design.  I may order another for a different window -- give the cats some variety!",2
5.0,Great treat made in the USA!,"August 27, 2015",Yes,My pups are really enjoying this!  I love that they're made in the USA with no chemical additives.  This will definitely be an addition to the treat menu for my 3 picky fox terriers!,1

5.0,Best Dog Shampoo Ever,"August 6, 2015",Yes,"My dog is an Australian Labradoodle, three years old.  I've tried 6 different high end shampoos for her, but none works as well as OMEGAPET Shampoo.  It gives a good lather, cleans superbly, and leaves her coat soft and shiny.  The fragrance is natural and light.  She is not scratching to relieve itches any more.  The effects (soft, shiny coat; no itching; clean coat) - all last longer as well.  I highly recommend this product.  I will use only OmegaPet from now on.  It's price is not outrageous, either.  It is wonderful.",0

They are in little pieces and crumble at the touch of them. There is maybe 1/4 if the bag that is to size.  How can I feed by dog crumbs??? Are you kidding me.  For $25.00 they should be better, like they used to me. I will not be purchasing again.",0

Have tried allergy-specific treatments for him that didn't work, the poor thing itches. Since starting the Skin and Coat tablets, he is itching less, which is great. I took 1 star off because he doesn't like the pills--eats around them if I put in with his food, so have to wrap them in cheese, and he swallows them whole. He is normally not a fussy eater at all. Still have only used them for about 2 weeks, so hopefully with time his itching will improve.",3

5.0,My cats love it.,"March 27, 2017",Yes,4 out of my 5 cats love these and the fifth one doesn't eat any treats  This is my second bottle and the 4 still are eating them. Thank you very much. Has not been a month yet to notice any difference but as long as they eat them I will buy them.,0

5.0,The only downside is you have to fill it frequently so I'd suggest hanging it in a place that's easy to get to,"January 15, 2016",Yes,I bought this for my indoor cats.. They sit on the window ledge and watch the birds up close all day. At first the birds were reluctant to come but they soon learned the cats couldn't get them. The only downside is you have to fill it frequently so I'd suggest hanging it in a place that's easy to get to. My backyard birds prefer it to the feeders hanging in the trees.,0

5.0,Shedding relief!,"September 29, 2017",Yes,"I have a German Shepherd who leaves more hair on the floor of my house than he has on his body!! Well, it seems like it anyhow. I have used all manner of brushes on him trying to lighten my housecleaning chore, but nothing seemed to help. Until, that is, I found this shedding comb. It's easy to use, easy to clean the hair out of it, and he really loves me combing him all over with it. He still sheds in the house some - it's still hot weather - but I don't have to sweep it up twice a day like before, now it's not too bad if I sweep it up every other day or so. So I'm really glad I found it! The smaller comb that came with it works great on the short-hair cats we have, too. If you have indoor shedding problems from your dog or cat, this set of combs will help a lot!",2

5.0,Great Product for Cats,"June 26, 2015",Yes,"I actually bought this product for my cat because of his sensitive skin. I have never seen a cat actually enjoy a bath but when I used the shampoo on my cat, he actually stood still and let me massage it into his fur. It smells great too not like a medicine. My experience has been limited as I just recently purchased the shampoo and have only had the opportunity to use it once since I have a cat, but I was very impressed with the first experience.",0

5.0,Smells great and works great,"May 3, 2016",Yes,"Even though Cannes doesn't look too enthusiastic in the picture but we really like the oatmeal aloe and shea butter dog shampoo by OmegaPet!  Just the other day, this pittie decided to roll in dirt (again) during our walk and I had just gotten the shampoo, no better time to try this shampoo out, right?  First off, I want to say that Cannes, or many Pitbull breed has skin problems.  She has very sensitive skin, when I first got her, she had flakes/dandruff all over her.  I had changed her lifestyle, diet, and shampoo in the past three years in order for her to have a transformation.  Most shampoos are too harsh for her skin, so we have been using Burt's Bee honey oatmeal.  When I came across the OmegaPet oatmeal aloe and shea butter shampoo, and I saw it uses all natural ingredients, I'm sold...Comparing this to Burt's Bees's, I have to say I am more satisfy with OmegaPet.  Little bit of OmegaPet shampoo goes a long way, we only need a small amount to get her bubbles up as compare to Burt's bees.  It cleans really well, her skin was so soft after wash, smells really good and the most important thing is, it did not cause any irritation to her skin.  A very gentle dog shampoo, two thumbs up~  A great product, would recommend...I hope Cannes won't roll in dirt anytime soon but if she does, no worries, I will wash her with this new shampoo by OmegaPet!..Sample given for review purposes.",0

5.0,Nice,"August 4, 2015",Yes,"Our dog has sensitive skin and seems to itch and ""breakdance"" a lot.  This shampoo helps when her skin allergies act up and soothes the itches for several days.",0
5.0,I am very happy with this purchase,"March 26, 2017",Yes,"I am very happy with this purchase. Excellent quality, good size, the paw design is very cute. And could not beat the price getting two bowls (1 for water, 1 for food) for less than other bowls sell for just one.",1
5.0,Me and my lab love it,"August 29, 2017",Yes,Works really well and gets out tons of loose fur out but is gentle on my lab.  We are both extremely satisfied,1
1.0,Easily Broken,"April 4, 2016",Yes,We enjoyed this bird feeder for 3 days. Then it fell from chest height and broke into 3 pieces when it hit the ground...One star for me. I didn't get a chance to ask the birds their thoughts.,1
5.0,I think our dog likes these new treats more than the old ones.,"July 29, 2015",Yes,"Just gave our dog one of the new treats (new process, same 100% chicken liver).  I think he likes these new treats more than the old ones.  Not sure if it's just because they are new or because they taste better, but either way he still loves these treats as much or more.  The new treats are the darker ones on bottom in the pic and the old ones the lighter ones on top.  I emailed Brave Beagle and they replied very quickly, stating: ""Yes, we are changing from rounding the corners to a dicing process.  The ingredient - USDA inspected liver - and manufacturing facility is the same.""  They also said, ""If you or your pets aren't happy let me know.  We will of course refund any purchase you have made if necessary.""  Seems like a great company.",2
5.0,Well built,"December 19, 2015",Yes,I really like the design on this. Plus it is extremely sturdy and well built. The removable seed drawer is so much better than cheaper feeders.,0

5.0,The tablets are very easy to break in half and he loves them,"June 18, 2016",Yes,"I purchased this product to help one of my cats with dry, itchy skin. While he eats a premium raw diet with lots of vitamins and nutrients, we've recently moved to a very hot and dry location, and I've now noticed him itching quite often. I also noticed that he developed a patch of dry, rough skin on one of his feet, and he seemed to have dandruff. I didn't want to have to deal with messy and smelly liquids, so I picked this product to try..The tablets are very easy to break in half and he loves them. They have very little smell but he seems to think they are a delicious cat treat. No problem getting him to eat them, and I've had to hide the bottle so he doesn't try to get more out..So far his coat seems a little softer and he seems less itchy. I am pleasantly surprised to have seen any changes this quickly, since I've only been giving them to him for five days. Hopefully the positive changes will continue!",3
3.0,Three Stars,"February 13, 2018",Yes,A lot smaller not as deep as it seems,1
5.0,Healthy and happy,"November 17, 2015",Yes,"I bought it because one of our dogs has recently become diabetic and must not have food between meals unless very small and pure protein. She has learned to expect a good treat to go in the kennel, so this is what we are trying. She gobbled a little piece right up this morning. So did her finicky sister.",1
5.0,The BEST dog shampoo for wirehair,"November 25, 2015",Yes,"He still doesn't love bath time, but we love this shampoo! I have tried a few different ones and this is my favorite by far. My dog is a wire-haired mutt, so his hair isn't naturally very soft but this shampoo actually makes it softer. I also love the scent. I have a super sensitive nose and can't stand very chemical-y, strong smells. This shampoo smells very natural and the lingering scent is really faint and soft. I can't stop petting and sniffing my dog! Definitely only buying this from now on.",5
5.0,good buy!,"April 22, 2016",Yes,"They are the perfect size for my lab!  It does slide, but very little.  I recommend this product!",1
5.0,Big fan of double-handle leashes; these are top quality!,"November 27, 2017",Yes,"I volunteer in a dog shelter so I was liking for a well-made, double-handle dog leash. Why?..Well, when you walk a dog past other dogs, everyone is protective of their territory. This is a temporary shelter so the dogs are in crates right now and taking a dog out of a crate for a walk is like running the gauntlet. Yes, you can hold the collar our lower on the leash for better control but for my money, the double-handle leash is the way to go...These are truly well made. The handles are comfortable and well padded. The leash is very sturdy. I haven't used it at the shelter yet, but I can tell it is going to be perfect. I've used enough leashes to know what I like and what works best. I hope to order more of these.",1
5.0,I love Omega products,"October 27, 2015",Yes,I love Omega products.  They do the job without harsh chemicals.  They stand behind their products and they want to make sure your satisfied.,0
3.0,Fills with water after it rains,"January 3, 2016",Yes,"Overall it's a ok window feeder, main flaw is that it fills with water when it rains, plan to drill little holes in the tray to offset this. Just hope it won't crack",0

5.0,Giving this to my dog who has skin issue and it is helping,"September 4, 2016",Yes,"I have one pure breed Shih Tzu who has atopic dermatitis for 2 years and one Bichon and Shih Tzu mix who doesn't have any health issues. I bought this for pure Shih tzu, but I am feeding both at the same time. They are under 20lbs so I need a table for two of them. They are always crazy about foods and not that picky about foods, but this does not have good flavor on it so I was little worried about it. However, unexpectedly they really like this and it's been 4 days and actually, I noticed that their fur is really getting soft. Tofu (pure shih tau) took Apoquil for almost year and now it doesn't seem helping him anymore so I stopped it finally and decided to give him this instead. Before I found this, he needed to take a bath every 3-4days (2days if it's severe), but.. I am not sure it will be for awhile but the term is actually little longer and his skin looks better than before! It's not dramatic difference, but as a dog owner who has dealt with dog skin problems for a long time, I can tell even small difference right away. I really hope this can help my dog and also I am waiting for other package which will be provided to him with this - Homeopathy medicine. I will update again soon.",0

5.0,"Get it - you'll see 'your' birds so close up, you won't believe it","January 28, 2016",Yes,"5 stars isn't enough for this little bird feeder.  My kitchen and breakfast room are on the 2nd story (ranch over daylight basement), so I can never see the bird feeders in the backyard from the house.  After enjoying a similar hummingbird feeder all summer, I decided that this would be fun for the winter.  It took about 2 days for the birds to find it, but MAN they are loving it.  I fill with black oil sunflower seeds and a little finch food, and I have such a variety of birds - from Cardinals and Tufted Titmice to Chickadees and Wrens.  They don't care if they lights are on.  They don't care if we watch them or take pictures (usually).  It is very easy to clean/fill and the suction cups haven't failed yet (applied per the included instructions).  My kids think 'their birds' are a hoot to watch.  We haven't had any accidents with birds hitting the windows, but have had some smaller birds hanging off the screens and perching nearby as they line up.  These birds are truly a delight - with the feeder at eye level you can watch them up close in a way you probably never have before.",0

5.0,Awesome bird feeder for any window,"September 18, 2014",Yes,"This bird feeder is great.  It is super clear, very easy to set up.  It was smaller than I was expecting, but it is a very good size...The base, which holds the food and has the perch, easily detaches for cleaning and filling.  It simply sets into two holes on the back, which is attached to the window by two large suction cups...It took several days for the local birds to find it.  I have it set up on a stationary pane of the sliding glass doors that go out to my balcony (which is on the 3rd floor).  I initially spread seed on the railing leading up to the base which I placed on the railing by the wall next to the window where I had attached the feeder...Once the birds were eating out of the base, I moved the feeder itself on the window (which is easy to do with the suction cups) so that it was down by the railing on the side and put the base back on the feeder...This, however, allowed a brazen squirrel to get in it.  When I came up to the window, he reluctantly went back to the railing and was just staring at me, as if to say ""What are you going to do about it?""  I stepped out onto the balcony and he scampered up the side of the building to the roof and peered over at me like he was waiting for me to leave so he could get back to his meal.  I moved the feed back to the center of the full-length window at shoulder height and haven't seen the squirrel since.  He'd have to be a flying squirrel with good aim to make it back into the feeder or would need suction cups on his feet to scale the window...The birds did start using it in the center of the window and now fight over a place on the perch...My cat loves watching the birds through the window.  He gives me dirty looks when I move around and scare the birds away from the feeder.  He says I'm a terrible wingman and he can't take me anywhere...I'm very happy with the purchase.  I highly recommend this feeder.",23

Oh my word...Within 5 minutes of opening, both my 90-pound mutt AND my 10 pound mega-kitten were trying to get at the bag, and wrestling for the honor of doing so...The smaller bits fit nicely in her Kong toy so I can load it up with a combination of chicken treats and peanut butter. She will attempt to obey my commands even before I've given them if these treats are within smell range. It's a riot. Between these and the freeze dried beef bites also purchased at Amazon, I have no need for anything else. Good size bag for the money, as well.",1

I don't know if it is an ingredient or if it is the amount of an ingredient...at any rate, I have had to stop giving it to both dogs...which is too bad, because I have one unopened bottle that I can't use now....I should add, that both dogs are Australian Shepherds...maybe it's the breed, but they can't take them...I have even experimented with doses and same result...itching...itching at the flank areas...both sides, both dogs",2

Very enjoyable for the whole family to be able to see the birds so close up!..Also it is pretty funny to watch the squirrels chattering at each other and plotting how to get up to the feeder over and over again. We've had it installed for a couple weeks now and this feeder seems to be squirrel-proof! (We placed it out of their jumping range.)..In the beginning, I admit I was concerned about birds hitting the window with this feeder, but they are smarter than that. They can swoop in at amazing speeds, pick up some seeds, and swoop out again. There is not a lot of room for more than a bird or two at a time so you may want to get more than one...Very easy to fill and a cinch to clean when needed.",0

Tried this product twice and can now finally write my review.  The first time I used it, her coat was shiny for maybe two days, so I thought it may be a user error.  Tried it again last week, leave it in for 5-10 minutes and rinse off.  This time, her coat was shiny and soft for 2 days and was dull and dry again.  Her skin was flaky and the itchy and scratching is also back after 2 days.  Okay product to use, but as far as helping with shiny coat and reduce itchy and scratching simply doesn't work.",0

I have fairly large dog and have to fill  water bowl 3-4 times a day.  Bowls I had before were huge and only needed filling once.  Thought two 32 oz bowls would be sufficient. But then got two 16 oz instead.  Misleading description -- Gpet Bowl (singular) 32 ounces leads you to believe one bowl is 32 oz not both bowls combined are 32 oz. Not first time misleading product info so just need to stop ordering from Amazon.,9

And then I noticed that it felt ""smooth"" to my touch. The shampoo lathered well and also seemed to brighten her coat somewhat. I've used the whitening shampoos on her before, and they seem to irritate her. I was very pleased with the results of the first couple of uses. I'll update later as I continue using it.",0

5.0,More unexpected consequences!,"May 2, 2016",Yes,"Birds found the feeder on day 2 and have been coming ever since. I purchased this feeder to stop feeding squirrels -- they climbed other feeder posts and defeated baffles and overcame spring-loaded feeders every time. Now I have a new problem. At 1 a.m. the other night, I was awakened by commotion in my back yard. As I approached the window that had the feeder attached, (I was inside the house) I realized that an animal had climbed up on my deck railing and was clinging to the feeder. It was a raccoon and had its snout in the seeds, with at least two legs flailing at the window and the siding. I knocked on the window and scared it, it must have released its toe-hold and fell, taking the whole feeder with it. The back of the feeder broke. In the morning I retrieved the pieces, glued them back together and remounted on the window about a foot higher...If this doesn't solve the problem and it happens again, I will have to concede defeat to the varmints again. If it does solve the problem, I will order a new feeder as the repair is obvious and somewhat unsightly.",0

Gave her one bath with it and lathered her up for a good ten minutes (which if you have ever bathed a cat, you know is a struggle)....When she dried, i brushed her with her wire brush and she was very soft and fluffy, but i didn't notice much of a difference in the dandruff. Maybe it needs a few washes to make a dent in it, it's just very hard to bathe them that often without losing a limb in the process. It smells amazing though, not perfumey or chemically like so many others, smells like cookies actually!",0

I've tried Din-O-Vite, this shampoo, anti itch capsules (probiotics, I think).  Anyway, nothing helps.  When she's not playing or sleeping, she is scratching, chewing, etc.  I'm at my wits end.

I tried this deshedding brush and the dog wasn‚Äôt very happy I tried it a couple of times and very little of the undercoat came off ( my regular brush collects so much more) I gave up and decided to return then brush and had a very difficult time removing the blade without cutting my fingers.

We had bought it for my three year old son to watch the birds right out the window, and it has been awesome. Woodpeckers, finches, things that look a bit like finches.

This brush is great for keeping her fluffy, looking like she just got back from the groomers. Here's the strange part. I have long hair, and a tendency towards dandruff.  The dandruf combs out in flakes, and trying to comb it out was bring hair along with it. This brush glides through my hair, taking loose dry scalp with it, and with a push of the button, everything falls into the trash. My dog and I both highly recommend the brush!",0

They figured out how to climb the window frame, even though it's metal.  They can also launch themselves from a nearby branch or roof.  The cardinals around me barely use this feeder, and the blue jays don't use it at all.  It's mostly chickadees and finches.  Also, the green strip where the birds perch will not stay on.  My cats absolutely love this thing however, and I'll keep it just for that reason.",0

This hasn't happened to us (we've had it up about 10 months), but I guess that depends on where you place it.",1

5.0,I would buy another one!,"January 25, 2016",Yes,"I purchased this window bird feeder because one of the Youtubers I watch made a gift idea video and this was one of the products she mentioned! I thought it would be cool to be able to watch birds from my bedroom window, so I bought it for myself..I ordered this product on December 26, 2015 and received it on December 30, 2015. However, I was only able to set it up the next week because of the constant rain. I do not remember the exact date I mounted the feeder. In the instructions that came with the product, it stated that it would take a few days for birds to discover the feeder. After a couple of weeks, I did not see any birds at all. However, I believe it was because it is attached to my bedroom window, which is on the second floor of the house. I thought about relocating it, but I decided to keep it there for a little longer..After coming back from a weekend trip, I saw that half of the food in the feeder was gone and that me really happy! So far, I have seen four different types of birds: Black-capped Chickadee, House Finch, Northern Cardinal, and even a Mourning Dove that could not find a way to get the food because he was too big, haha..Recently, winter storm Jonas came by and I was scared that my feeder would fall off. Being the person that I am, I was too lazy to remove it from the window. The winds were pretty strong despite not getting the most intense parts of the storm like in the north. After the storm subsided, my feeder was perfectly fine! It just got dirty from the snow. The suction cups that came with the feeder work very well.

3.0,Too many crumbs ffor a treat.,"December 24, 2015",Yes,"There were a lot of ""tiny crumbs"" that I did not expect. It's hard to give a piece of the treat when it's crumbs.  Since the bag was not completely fill, the product may have been tossed around during shipment and therefore there were ""many crumbs.""  It would have been better if there had been a type of ""filler"" in the space to prevent toss around.  Maybe the treats were too brittle or sorts.  Had to give several crumbs to each of my pets, although they did like it.  But, not sure if I would purchase again.",0

No fault of the product...A little disappointed that this new batch has some issued with the green rubber extrusions. The groove that allows them to fit not onto the acrylic is too narrow. I've noticed after a day they're already starting to come off. Weird because I never had the issue with the original one and it was out for close to a year. I took a picture of the extrusion from the older feeder and the new one. I'm guessing a new supplier made these out of spec...Other than that they seem great...Update:..I've had ours up since the Fall 2014. It's been through a pretty rough Chicago winter through sub-zero temps and hasn't fallen off once. If your unit falls off after a day, the glass might not have been cleaned properly...I need to buy another one since the birds clear this thing out in a day if there's a lot of snow on the ground......I'm outside of Chicago here and installed this a number of weeks ago. It took that long for the birds to find it, but the cardinals seem to really like it. As far as the quality of the unit, it's very good. Plastic is clear and seems very durable. The suction cups are holding up very well with the cold as well. We like it so much, we're going to order up more of these.",9

It comes unassembled but the blade clicks in place with a nice, satisfying sound. Worked well on my dog.

When walking, he has jerked forward a few times and once I couldn't hold him with his regular lease. So, I made a second knot &amp; handle in his regular lease to give me more control.  When I saw these 2-handled leases by QOL TOP, I was excited to get one and give it a try.  It works great.  I'd prefer a little shorter overall lease (like 4 or 5 feet vs. 6 feet) but it's fine.

We haven't had a lot of birds on it, but enough to entertain our pets and us. Easy to clean - just slide it up and off the suction cups and rinse/dry and refill. I was concerned with a bird flying into the window to get it but husband assured me that would not be the case; they don't fly into birdfeeders and that's what they're seeing. Of course! :) Cardinals have especially been drawn to ours with a general birdseed mix.",0

It fell off the window after about 6 months. But since they had enjoyed it so much I purchased them this one for a Christmas gift. I am sorry to say that it didn't even stay on the window a week before it also fell off and broke. I guess the suction cups are just not stronger enough to hold. We went right by the directions. It is so sad because it is lots of fun to watch the birds when they come so close up to feed.,4

I just bought a second one to replace one of the other brands I had.",0
4.0,Great dog bowl,"July 22, 2016",Yes,Great dog bowl. Not as large as our previous one so we end up filling it more often since we have a 50 lb dog and two thirsty cats.

5.0,Functional window feeder,"December 10, 2015",Yes,"Easy to mount with strong suction cups. Just wash the window well first. I like the fact that I can remove the seed tray from the mount for filling or cleaning without removing the whole feeder from the glass.  A couple of small drain holes might be nice. While the overhang protects the seed from typical rainy weather, wind can blow rain into the tray.  Overall, I am happier with this feeder compared to one I bought from Droll Yankees.  I bought one for my daughter's new apartment for Christmas.",0

The overhang in no way protects the seed from rain (oh well) which means I have to constantly change the seed.

5.0,Great quality!,"June 14, 2016",Yes,This bird feeder had all of the features I wanted - they really put a lot of thought into design compared to others I looked at.

5.0,"Very nice, but alas","December 30, 2016",Yes,"Very nice, but alas, I situated the feeder too close to the screened half of double glass sliding doors, and OF COURSE it didn't take long for an ambitious squirrel to scramble up the screen and reach just far enough to grab some seed.  Then of course the squirrel leapt onto the little feeder, causing it to crash to the ground.  Unfortunately one of the ""lips"" for  attaching the feeder to the back section broke, so that was it.

3.0,The Search Goes On,"April 8, 2015",Yes,"Got this shampoo a couple months back because my dog has been itching herself like crazy and I was trying to figure out a solution at least reduce her itching constantly (had her for over a year and a half so I know this isn't just something she does).  Right off the bat when receiving bottle, there was shampoo all over the container and in the box, luckily it didn't get on the other things that were packaged with it since they were in sealed bags.  My issue with the shipping is not based off the shampoo product itself, that is a shipping issue from the seller so this rating I'm given it is reflecting the product itself, just not happy with the packaging (some people use a shipping issue as a product review which is not a good practice when you're doing a product review).  Me giving it at least 3 stars comes from strictly how great the product smells and it seems to make a good lather when using it.  The main issue I had with this product is that it is designed to help eliminate itchy and dry skin.  This product had absolutely no effect on reducing my dogs itching.  She was good for alittle bit after her bath but it returned to same way the next day.  Just to be clear, there was small skin flakes so this isn't a bug or flea issue. I will continue to research and look for products until I can find a solution to the problem but this wasn't it unfortunately.",3

5.0,clean and happy pup,"April 11, 2015",No,"I saw an offer on this shampoo just as we ran out of the last bottle of dog shampoo. I like the light fragrance, it's not to strong and doesn't make my dog smell weird! (We once had one that made him smell like pina colada right after a bath... of course it didn't last long.) His coat was nice and soft and shiny after using this shampoo, so no complaints. I also love that it's made in the USA. Not only are we supporting our own economy, I don't have to worry about the substandard quality many imported pet products have. My dog seems to be scratching less too, which I'm crediting to this shampoo's skin conditioning since we know he didn't/doesn't have fleas. All said, I would recommend this shampoo to anyone!",12
5.0,Great quality bowls.  Love that it comes in a set of two.,"April 13, 2016",No,"Bottom Line Up Front:  These are great large dog bowls that I would recommend getting for you dog.  It is nice that this comes in a set of two so one of the bowls can be used for food and the other can be used for water...I wanted to get another food bowl for my dog.  His food bowl was getting all gross and although I have cleaned it a couple of times, it was just time to replace it.  I saw this set and decided to give it a try.  The following are my thoughts regarding this product:..**Pros.1.  Quality -  These are very well made bowls and it is nice that it is made out of stainless steel.  My dog's bowl was made out of ceramic and I already saw some cracking in the bowl.  At least with the construction of this bowl, I will not have to worry about that..2. Design - The design is very simple and clean.  It is also nice that there is a rubber at the bottom of the bowl that prevents it from skidding all over the place.  At least with these bowls, once I sent them down, they do not slide when my dog is eating his food..3. Quantity - Although I was only looking for one bowl, it is nice that this came with two. Not realizing it but it is nice to have the same style bowl for both my dog's water and food...**Cons.1.  Size - The only con that I would say with this product that is worth mentioning is that it does have a wide base.  With a wide base, it does take up a bit of floor space.  If you are looking for something that is compact, this may not be for you.  However, if you do not have a problem with this, these bowls will be perfect for you...Disclaimer: I did receive this product at a discount but this in no way influenced my review of this product...Please indicate if this review was helpful.",5

I assumed that there was aloe vera in the shampoo but, if I am correct, it said 'aloe vera scent' not 'gel.'  I donated the remainder of the shampoo to my shelter.

5.0,With these you can teach an old dog new tricks!,"July 5, 2015",No,These treats are not exactly what I was expecting when I ordered them but they are fantastic for training my dog. Usually when I buy treats they come in a bag like this but the bag is either fat and heavy with lots of treats or super skinny with very few treats in it. I was expecting a fairly heavy bag for so many treats. I should have paid more attention to the fact that these are freeze dried because if you've ever tried astronaut food you know that freeze dried food is extremely light weight yet at the same time you can get a lot in a small amount of space. These treats are no exception. When you are holding them it feels like little more than air. The whole bag is thin and light but there are lots of treats inside that my dog goes crazy for. When I first opened the package he was practically climbing over me to get into my lap for a treat since he could smell the flavor. When I told him to sit he obeyed right away. My dog is older so he knows the basic commands but for some reason when my family trained him all those years ago we forgot to teach him to stand back up after sitting for a treat. I thought it was a lost cause to teach him anything new since he is quite stuck in his ways and as they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks but it turns out with these you can. We still have some work to do to get the lesson to stick but with these treats as an incentive my dog is the most willing student...Note: Product purchased at a discount in exchange for an honest review.,4
5.0,BEST. STUFF. EVER.,"January 5, 2017",No,"I can't begin to tell you how awesome this product is! We have two rescue cats - one is a male Sealpoint Siamese (named Otis) with thick, dense fur and the other is a female Snowshoe Sealpoint Siamese (named Ziva) whose fur is longer and softer, like hair. We started to notice that Otis was getting dandruff and no matter how often we brushed him, his fur felt dry. They both eat high-quality dry food (RC Siamese Breed Health) and get canned wet food daily. I read that adding fish oil to their diets could help the dry fur/dandruff situation. After researching the options, I decided I did not want to deal with the smelly and messy liquid fish oils and tried these tablets...MY CATS LOVE THESE!! We give a half a tablet to each of them daily and they gobble them up as if they are kitty crack. We've seen a HUGE difference in Otis's fur (took about  7-10 days). The dandruff is no more and his thick coat is soft and shiny. Ziva already had a gorgeous coat but these supplements have made her fur feel like mink. Sooooo soft! HIGHLY recommend!",1
5.0,Oatmeal Shampoo,"March 27, 2015",No,"I finally got around to trying out this product after finishing up previous shampoo for my furbabies. I have two all white dogs, so I am always on the look out for new shampoos that can maintain their white coats. I usually go with blue shampoos, but my groomers always seem to use oatmeal based shampoos, so I decided to give this brand a try...Scent: Holy Moly. Upon opening this bottle it was like opening up an oven with fresh baked, sugary oatmeal cookies. The scent is initially very intense, but doesn't maintain the strong scent after rinsing..Cleaning Ability: The lather was easy to obtain to achieve a good, clean coat. It left my dogs hair very soft and smooth. It didn't irritate my dogs skin and it made brushing easy...Even though it is a bit outside my normal price range, I would definitely purchase again in the future. This is a great quality product for those looking to treat your pets to a luxury bathing experience.",4
1.0,Itch Shampoo,"April 7, 2015",Yes,"This shampoo made my dog even itchier..After a bath, my dog is pretty itch-free, but this shampoo kept me up all night with my dog's scratching...My dog is a bully type dog with white fur and pink skin.  He's sensitive to plant oils and needs to be bathed at least once a week..I'm always on the look out for products that will help soothe his itchy skin..This most definitely was not it...Also, the label weirdly got sticky once it was wet.  Which is pretty much anytime you use it.",4
5.0,"Smells great, no itchiness!","October 26, 2016",No,"I just used this shampoo on our two lab mixes.  It smells great, just like a light scent of maybe coconut or vanilla, but not overpowering.  Remember back in the day when all dog shampoos had that awful wet-dog smell?  Thank god there are companies that have started making dog shampoos that actually smell like something you want your dog to smell like...One of our dogs had itchy skin when we brought her home from the shelter.  I thought it might just be dirt/fleas/something from the shelter, so I bathed her with some main-brand dog shampoo that I already had in the house, but she was still itchy for days afterward.  I bought a different all natural itch-free dog shampoo on Amazon, and it really worked.  But I don't want to be pigeonholed into just one brand, so I figured I'd try this brand, too...This shampoo is just as good.  It's a light oatmeal color, rather than the artificial nearly fluorescent pinks, blues, or oranges of some of the other major-brand shampoos.  The fragrance is nice, light, and natural-smelling.  I'm sure the lack of dyes and heavy fragrances makes a big difference in cutting down on itchiness.  The dogs obviously liked the smell, too, since one of them started trying to lick it off while I was scrubbing her.  :)  After the bath, their fur was soft and fluffy, and no itchiness from either of them!",0
5.0,Lightweight and good quality,"June 7, 2016",No,"My boyfriend and I love bird watching. It's summer and we have a small garden that is visited by many cute birds. I wish they would linger longer so I'm so glad I got this window bird feeder. I love how I can securely attach the feeder to any window - the suction cups are pretty heavy duty and definitely can hold up quite a bit! I wish it came with 2 extra suction cups just in case. This feeder comes with a green rubber perch to mimic tree branches, which is a cute feature and does seem to attract birds. It's perfect for the summer but if you live in a rainy area, I'd recommend getting something with drain holes in both the main feeder and removable tray. I can drill holes in there easily though. That would also keep the seed from staying wet and growing mold.This tray is easy to fill up with bird seed and place inside the feeder...This durable and lightweight window bird feeder is built with high quality premium acrylic. I don't like seeing metal because it rusts and acrylic allows me to see the birds eating which is so fun. I just squeal with delight every time I see them eat. This unit comes with a nice removable feed tray, which makes it so easy to clean or refill the bird feeder. In regards to cleaning, I usually just handwash it because it's so simple and haven't encountered any mold yet. I haven't tried putting in the dishwasher yet so I can't speak to whether it is dishwasher safe. Simple installation/cleaning instructions provided right on the packaging. I'm not the handiest person and I was able to put it together easily...For full disclosure, I received this item at a discounted price or for free in return for my honest and unbiased review after using the product. I am not influenced by the seller to leave a review other than what I honestly believe it should receive. I hope that you have found this review helpful and feel free to ask any questions.

I noticed right away how nice and soft as well as shiny her coat was with just 1 bath. I think she was almost instantly less itchy and more comfortable. I plan to give her a bath once a week with this so we might be able to get her skin under control...I really like that there are no harsh chemicals or ingredients in this product, as well as no strong scent. She's had no adverse reactions and smells nice and clean. I do notice a difference with her itching and she's itching far less than she has in weeks. That to me is the best possible outcome I could ask when trying something new for my dog. I'm so happy this has made such a difference for her after just a couple of baths...I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for relief for their dog, from very itchy skin. This works great and my dog is so much happier...*Iu received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. The discount has not influenced or impacted my judgement of this product.

5.0,"Great leash due to the second handle, which is well padded, and the clip, which is great for a clicker, bags, keys, etc.","November 28, 2017",No,"I've to an 80 pound pit bull who, by nature, is a puller.  He's also not happy with skateboards and scooters here in NYC, which means walking him is tough work...With this leash, while it is still tough work, it is easier than with a standard leash.  This second handle allows me to keep my dog closer, i.e., on a short leash, when necessary.  Unlike others I've tried, this is not a strap, but a fully padded second handle that is as comfortable as the first.  It starts about 1 foot from the clip and is several inches long...The metal clip by the main handle is great - I've got a clicker and my house key clipped on it.  While I keep my bags in a treat pouch, a bag container  would fit on this clip just fine...This is my leash of choice for my puller.",0
5.0,I was amazed at how it leaves his coat so soft!,"June 29, 2016",No,"I am in love with this Dog Shampoo by OmegaPet - probably not as much as my dog is though.  We have a Feist Terrier/Jack Russell mix - a crazy dog that loves to run outside in the rain and get muddy.  So he needs a bath more often than we can give him one as most shampoos we have used are very drying to his already dry skin.  He doesn't have fleas but he often scratches because his skin is so dry...I saw an immediate difference in just ONE use of this shampoo.  Its' all natural - made of Oat Extract, Shea Butter and Aloe Vera - all ingredients known to be moisturizing.  The scent is very pleasant - he didn't just smell like wet dog!  It lathered good and rinsed easily.  And I was amazed at how it leaves his coat so soft!  He has very short, coarse, white hair and the first thing I noticed after his bath was how SOFT his hair is.  I know if it leaves his hair that soft it has to be moisturizing his skin as well.  I have not seen him scratching as much this week...I like the fact that it is made in the USA - which always means higher quality ingredients to me.  I would highly recommend this shampoo to anyone with any type of dog...I did purchase this product at discount for an honest review and this is my 100% unbiased opinion, solely based on MY experience with it.",0

I have a shih tzu and I swear since the day I got him, he has had skin issues (he will be 6 this month). Heres a little background....This past year it has been his armpits that have been giving him hell and just a few months ago I found a product that really helps. After so many days, he needs a bath or else its like applying ointment to an unclean wound. This boy licks and licks all day everyday. I bought a soothing shampoo but every time I bathed him I would need to hold him until he dried so not to mess with the hot spots. With this shampoo from OmegaPet, I swear he licked once right after his bath and hasn't since. It's a freakin miracle and holy vanilla he smells like I had him groomed at a doggy spa...My one and only ""complaint"" is it seemed like I had to use quite a bit because it's a very thick lather. However I will try again and see if it was just me...It smells wonderful and seems to be soothing his skin. I will update in the near future!",0

My dog proudly exclaimed this is currently her favorite shampoo Oatmeal Dog Shampoo &amp; Conditioner (Best Smelling Natural Wash) Aloe Vera and Shea to Relieve Dry Itchy Skin - Pet Odor Eliminator for Puppies and Cats - 16 oz.  Here is what she says..Why is this my favorite shampoo? It smells like oatmeal cookies and the smell makes my mommy craving some oatmeal cookies whenever I take my bathe..How does it wash? My mommy said she loves this because just a little shampoo cleans my fur really well and lather awesome and the smell is so good. Most importantly, the oatmeal smell does not linger after the shower because she does not want me to smell like a walking oatmeal cookie.  The shampoo does not dry my skin or feels dry either..My fur? It is so nice and stays that way for a long time. Now I want another bath.

5.0,Simply the best feeder!,"August 5, 2014",No,"WOW, this thing works!.I wasn't sure how well this feeder would work, but this thing is awesome!  Don't use the generic 25 pound bags you find at Wallymart, get the good stuff.  With the right seed, this thing is a bird magnet...As far as the features, This feeder looks as though it is better designed than some others. It is a very simple and functional design...The first thing I noticed about this brand is the quality of the acrylic; it is a super clear type that does not distort when you look through it...Another feature that I really love is the removable feed tray.  With this feeder, you don't have to pull the whole thing off of the window to clean it out..It has a well designed roof.  The roof blocks the rain but does not block access for the bird to approach and land...The suction cups are very strong, but you have to clean the window very well before mounting!  Don't skip this step!",15
5.0,My Dog looks great.,"June 24, 2016",No,"I have 2 mastiff dogs. I absolutely  love them beyond measure. My female has had several litter of puppies where only 3 survived out of double digit litters. She is a great mama and the doctor's say she is fairly healthy except for the yeast spot on her back. So, I thought I would allow her one more try and I want to get her extra healthy.  I was also hoping  this formula would help with that spot on her back..These pills are rather large, even for her, and she wouldn't  take them with disguising them.  So, I cut them up and put them in chunks of meat and she eats them quickly. After 3 weeks, I have noticed her hair shinning  more and also her skin is a little clearer  on her back. I am hoping that these pills also make her a little bit more healthy throughout her body.  I will continue to give her these pills because they are healthy and seem to be improving her hair and skin. I did receive these pills at a discount to review  and give my honest and unbiased opinion.  I will be purchasing more and giving to both dogs.",0
5.0,Best window bird feeder on the market!,"October 22, 2016",No,"This is the best window bird feeder avaialbe. I am buying my second one after buying a different, slightly larger one that I found was not nearly as good as this one. This one is the easiest to maintain and refill. The hooking mechanism for refills is wonderful. It is a snap to get off an on. Also, when it needs to be removed from the window for cleaning, it is very easy. I found it to be extremely sturdy staying on the window. Never fell off once in the 2 years we used it before it finally came apart at the back seam and had to be replaced. I live in a very cold climate so I am happy to have gotten 2 years of use through harsh winters. Also the birds enjoy sitting on the ""upper deck"" while waiting their turn at the seed. And my cats absolutely love it! Put a kitty codo in front of the window where the bird feeder is and they will have hours of entertainment! Definitly recommend!!",0
5.0,"Good lather, good cleaning, good smell, and good for the skin","December 12, 2015",No,"My wife is a professional dog groomer and she used this shampoo on our outside dog Tucker.  He had some dry flaky skin near his ass and he was making a horrible slathering sound when he was chewing on it.  He might have been stung by fire ants or something.  Also, he smelled horrible, sort of like Sasquatch was sumo wrestling and then took a dump onto a tire burning in smoldering hair next to a carnival ride that a bunch of people puked on.  I'm not even sure why Sasquatch would be sumo wrestling or why that contributed to Tucker's perceived fragrance but I'm telling you what he smelled like: horrid...After the wife used this shampoo on him, no more stink and he stopped making that slathering sound, and a few days later his ass is looking better.  I found a coupon code on the internet that gave me a modest discount on the price and the website asked (but did not require) that I leave a product review whether it was good or bad.  Good smelling dog=good review.",0
5.0,I am really happy with this supplement for my pups,"September 26, 2016",No,I am really happy with this supplement for my pups. My Rat Terrier's love this supplement. This has helped out so much with their shedding and dry skin. My Lab isn't a fan of them but after a little coaxing he will take them. It has helped his coat so much. It's full and so shiny. He gets very dull and fuzzy without some type of an oil supplement. All three dogs have been better about itching also. I would highly recommend adding this supplement to your pup's daily routine. Along with healthy diet this helps make their coat and skin feel amazing!.I hope my review helps!,1
4.0,"Well-made, easy to fill and fun feeder","November 28, 2015",No,"My cats love it!  I originally bought a feeder like this with a 2-way mirror.  The intent was that we could see the birds, but the birds couldn't see us.  Two flaws with that.  One, the ""mirror"" made the glass appear quite dark and tinted, making it harder to see the birds.  Second, we had an incredibly persistent male Cardinal in the years.  He would get up at dawn and start attacking the feeder repeatedly, scattering birdseed everywhere.  Out of concern that he would hurt himself attacking his image in the mirror, I tried several ways of blocking the mirror (cardboard, post-its, etc) to no lasting avail.  Plus, when the mirror was blocked we could no longer view the birds.  Enter this replacement feeder.  Soooo much better!  The plastic is crystal clear and the cardinal leaves it alone.  My only wish is that it were bigger.  It is also prone to getting the seed wet since it is not contained.  Nice product!",0
5.0,My dogs LOVE these!,"October 3, 2016",No,"My dogs love this!  I haven't been using it long enough to know if assists in pet skin and coat, but am going to give it to my dogs in the hopes that it does.  I have two little Yorkie's and they both have problems with dry skin and itching.  I'm hoping this product alleviates their issues.  I was particularly impressed with this company and love the fact that these products are made in the USA.  This is a really good way to get your dog some important vitamins and minerals in their diet and apparently it tastes good... I have that on good accord from two very picky Yorkies!",1
4.0,Healthy Treats but Expensive!,"July 2, 2015",No,"I have two dogs,  a golden retriever and a husky and I regularly purchase high quality food and treats for them. So when I saw that I could get this product for a reduced price, I jumped at the deal.  My first impression hit me right away,  they smell awful,  but that means they have should be all nature.  I have made homemade liver treats and it smelled similar.  Both of the dogs enjoyed the treats.  So I gave them a test between the treats and their usual treats,  carrots.  I tested it three times per dog,  keeping them both separated for each test,  and the Golden perfered the carrots  2 to 3 and the husky perfered the treats 2 to 3, so no definitive answer. So with the regular price of $24 (reason for 1 star reduction)  I think I will be staying with the $2 per bag of healthy carrots.",1
5.0,"Happy healthy dog with softer, shinier fur and less scratching himself.","October 22, 2016",No,"The dog loves these, he thinks they are doggie treats.  I shake the bottle and he comes running.  I bought the bottle because it was recommended for his dry skin/scratching.  He used to rub along the walls, corners, furniture and scratch his face repeatedly.  He has been taking them nearly daily for almost a month.  He has stopped rubbing and chewing his skin so much.  As an added bonus his fur has become softer and really a lot shinier and healthier looking.  We have taken Omega 3's for quite some time and so it just makes sense to give it to our furrier family member too.",1
